# Database-Airport-Project
In this project I designed an application , which is for an international airport that wants to keep track of airlines, flights, passengers, baggage, etc. 
First, I built a database for the airport and implemented the design in ORACLE. Next, I built the connection between a servelet and the database and html to accomplish the following functionalities:

a. Given an airline find all the routes it operates.
b. Given a place (e.g. Toronto) find all the routes from and to that place.
c. Given a time of the day find all the arrivals and departures around that
time and print their status.
d. Given a departure or arrival find all the passengers recorded for it. Print
all the information about these passengers.
e. For a given passenger in a flight find his/her baggage.
f. Find a free gate for a flight (arrival or departure).
g. Assign a flight as “done” and return the gate
h. Create forms to populate (insert data into) tables. Passengers and Baggages will be inserted in batches sent by airlines. Thus, I created programs that populate the corresponding tables from text files. 
i. Create a form to perform a route deletion.
